# Assumptions

Where the brief was not explicit, this is what I assumed and why.

## Identity

- **The student is identified only by `X-Student-Id`** (17-digit birth registration number).
  There is no login, as the brief says. It must be exactly 17 ASCII digits; anything else is
  `400`. The UI also accepts Bangla digits (`০-৯`) and spaces or dashes and normalises them
  before sending, because parents often type it that way.
- **The admin screen is not protected.** The brief says "no login", so anyone can create a
  class. In a real deployment this screen would sit behind authentication.
